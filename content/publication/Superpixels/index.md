# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Studies of complex networks have been an important topic of interest to many researchers, in part due to its potential for a simple representation of complex systems in various fields of science.  This work aims to develop and study some methods used for the characterization of complex networks. Thus, a new approach to the dermatoscopic image analysis that combines extraction of superpixels and detection of communities of a complex network is expected to be developed. To reduce the computational cost, a SLIC preprocessing algorithm will be used to group several pixels of the image into a uniform region (superpixels), which will decrease the size of the network and, consequently, minimize the computational cost of the cluster."
