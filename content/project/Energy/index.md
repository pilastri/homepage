### REN ENERGY CHALLENGE 

Alian√ßa Portuguesa de Blockchain (Finalist Project)

How can we use the Blockchain to potentiate the National Energy Network?

In this context, I and [Danilo Jodas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danilo-jodas/) and more some friends decided to take part in the Challenge REN and we created:

Dinamis platform is a marketplace for the energy sector that integrates producers, traders and consumers in a single environment of peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. The proposal aims at the concentration of all the intermediaries of the energy sector in a single platform that uses the blockchain technology.
