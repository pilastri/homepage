Maintaining steady productivity and meeting customer demands throughout the year is a growing challenge in the logistics industry, especially with the explosive growth of e-Commerce. Vision Picking is an innovative way to increase the agility of your supply chain by employing the latest Deep learning technology in your warehousing operations.\nWhen it comes to supplying chain operations, the vast majority of warehouses in the developed world still use a pick-by-paper approach. A paper-based approach requires cost intensive training, is relatively slow and prone to errors. Vision Picking in warehousing operations can help address these challenges, increasing productivity.\nHow does it work? A pick operator wearing smart glasses loads a batch of orders to be picked and after the product recognition, receives information from the next location where a pick is to be performed. As the operator navigates toward the location, the smart glasses scan the location barcode and validate that the operator is in the right place. The built-in vision system recognizes the product and verifies the correct item is picked. Operators are visually and audibly guided to place the product in the right position on the picking cart. A pick is then complete, and the system updates the order status and inventory levels. The operator executes the prior steps until the batch of orders is completed.\nBenefits of Vision Picking  Mobile solution - Wearable technology is fully mobile and can be used without recharging for a long period of time, covering an entire shift of operation.\n Rich graphical user interface – Full color, high-resolution displays provide a visually equivalent image to a smartphone display. Displays can also show rich information without the need for carrying a handheld device.\n Voice-controlled processing - With built-in speakers, microphone, and voice recognition engine, smart glasses capture and execute voice commands.\n Barcode scanning and image capture - With a built-in camera and ability to capture video, scanning of barcodes is an integral part of smart glass technology.\n Vision-aided processing - In conjunction with the built-in camera, the vision recognition framework helps with accuracy of supply chain operations, for example, picking the correct product during an order fulfillment process.\n Global positioning – A built-in GPS system aids with operator navigation and positioning within the warehouse.\n Gesture controls – A gesture recognition engine within the smart glasses can recognize certain head or body movement, which can serve as commands to the system.\n Hands-free processing – The entire system is located in the smart glasses, and it does not require hands to operate.\n Potential low cost of ownership – As smart glasses find their use in both the consumer and enterprise market, the demand will drive the prices down, and smart glasses will become more affordable than some existing mobile solutions in the supply chain.\n  The next logical step in the evolution of the retail industry is to deploy AI not only to improve customer experience but also to bolster its operations and processes.\nInterested?

This work aims to develop and study some methods used for the characterization of complex networks. Thus, a new approach to the dermatoscopic image analysis that combines extraction of superpixels and detection of communities of a complex network is expected to be developed. To reduce the computational cost, a SLIC preprocessing algorithm will be used to group several pixels of the image into a uniform region (superpixels), which will decrease the size of the network and, consequently, minimize the computational cost of the cluster.","tags":["Complex Networks","Superpixels","Skin"],"title":"Segmentation of Skin in dermatoscopic images using SuperPixels combined with Complex Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["André Pilastri","Daniel F.

The SVM input data is transformed into a high dimensional space using some kernel functions where linear separation is more likely. However, there are some computational drawbacks associated to SVM. One of them is the computational burden required to find out the more adequate parameters for the kernel mapping considering each non-linearly separable input data space, which reflects the performance of SVM. This paper introduces the Polynomial-Powers of Sigmoid for SVM kernel mapping, and it shows their advantages over well-known kernel functions using real and synthetic datasets.","tags":["SVM","PPS","Learning","Kernel"],"title":"Learning Kernels for Support Vector Machines with Polynomial Powers of Sigmoid","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
